\section{\bf Instructions for Citations in the Document}

It is likely that you will need to cite other books, articles, etc. For example,
you may want to refer to a certain page in the textbook to describe where the
algorithm is defined. Make sure you provide a thorough set of citations. As
a concrete example consider the algorithm for Newton's method on page 116 of
\cite{AscherGrief}. Make sure you cite any algorithms or mathematics that you
use in explanations.
